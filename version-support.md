|                              |                                                                    |

[^1]: Will be supported as of **Nexo 1.13**

[^2]: Nexo 1.10+

[^3]: Support for this version is planned to be dropped for Nexo 1.13

[^4]: These versions are labelled as "**Unsupported"** because they were quickly followed by a new release to fix bugs. There is no reason to use any of these versions in favor of the above-mentioned ones.\
    \
    Nexo might still work on these releases but in no way is it ideal to use
