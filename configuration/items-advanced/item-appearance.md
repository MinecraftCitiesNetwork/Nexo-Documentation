# Special Item Appearance

### Invisible Item (1.21.4+)

To make an invisible item with Nexo, you can use the Nexo provided ItemModel `nexo:empty`.\
This will render nothing for that Item no matter where it is used.

Here is a basic config-example for an invisible NexoItem

```yaml
invisible_item:
  Components:
    item_model: nexo:empty
```

You can also use this in any other plugin, assuming they allow you to specify the ItemModel of your Item.

### Oversized Items in GUI (1.21.6+)

As of 1.21.6+, Mojang made changes to how items render in the GUI.\
By default they are no longer allowed to go beyond their 16x16 grid, but added an option called `oversixed_in_gui` to ItemModels to return this behaviour.\
In Nexo you can use this for your items by following the below example;

```yaml
oversized_item:
  material: PAPER
  Pack:
    oversized_in_gui: true
    model: my_oversized_model
  Components:
    item_model: nexo:oversized_item
```

Here we do not use CustomModelData as that would apply to all items using PAPER.\
If you are not sure what an ItemModel is, think of it as the **base model** of an item.\
By default all items using the material PAPER will use **minecraft:paper.**\
By specifying our own ItemModel here, we are changing the base-model of our item, preventing any conflicts or issues, and Nexo can properly mark the config

### Use a different model for Inventory Icon vs Equipped/In-Hand

{% hint style="info" %}
This is for 1.21.2+ servers & clients only
{% endhint %}

If you want to say have an item with a 2D icon in the inventory but when worn on head or held in your hand, it uses a 3D model or another 2D icon, you can do so by following the below

You need to provide an ItemModel that specifies when to show what model.\
Here is an example using a `mymodel_icon` model for the GUI and a "fallback" for everything else.\
This approach can be used for most other contexts, which you can find [here](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Items_model_definition#display_context).\
This is not a detailed guide on ItemModels, but you can do very complex things with them beyond this.

```json
{
  "model": {
    "type": "select",
    "property": "display_context",
    "cases": [
      {
        "when": "gui",
        "model": {
          "type": "model",
          "model": "namespace:mymodel_icon" // The model to display for the GUI
        }
      }
    ],
    "fallback": {
      "type": "model",
      "model": "namespace:mymodel" //The model that is used everywhere else
    }
  }
}
```

You can put this inside `Nexo/pack/assets/namespace/items/mymodel.json` .

Then you can make your NexoItem-config, which will reference this ItemModel

```yaml
myitem:
  itemname: "My Item"
  Components:
    item_model: namespace:mymodel
```

***

{% hint style="info" %}
All the methods below support a `BLANK_texture` or `BLANK_textures` aswell as models if all you have is a PNG\
For example for a 2D bow with different pulling-stages.
{% endhint %}

### Blocking Model (Shields)

```yaml
myitem:
  Pack:
    model: example_shield.json #json extension is not mandatory
    blocking_model: example_shield_blocking.json #json extension is not mandatory
```

### Pulling Models (Bows / Crossbow)

```yaml
myitem:
  Pack:
    model: default/combat_bow
    pulling_models:
      - default/combat_bow_pulling_0
      - default/combat_bow_pulling_1
      - default/combat_bow_pulling_2
```

### Charged Model (Crossbow)

```yml
myitem:
  Pack:
    model: default/custom_bow
    pulling_models:
      - default/custom_bow_pulling_0
      - default/custom_bow_pulling_1
      - default/custom_bow_pulling_2
    charged_model: default/custom_bow_pulling_2
    firework_model: default/custom_bow_charged #Optional
```

### Cast Model (Fishing Rods)

```yml
myitem:
  Pack:
    model: default/fishing_rod
    cast_model: default/fishing_rod_cast
```

### Damaged Model (Based on durability)

```yml
myitem:
  Pack:
    model: default/diamond_sword
    damaged_models:
      - default/diamond_sword_damaged1
      - default/diamond_sword_damaged2
      - default/diamond_sword_damaged3
```
