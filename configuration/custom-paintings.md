# üñºÔ∏è Custom Paintings

As of 1.21 you can now make custom paintings via datapacks. Nexo streamlines this process by automating the generation of this datapack based on a `Nexo/paintings.yml` file.

Here is an example of adding a custom painting:

```yaml
paintings:
  nexo:custom_painting:
    author: boy0000
    title: <red>Custom Painting
    asset_id: nexo:my_custom_painting  # This is the path to the PNG, namespace:path
    width: 1     # The width of your painting, in number of blocks it takes up
    height: 1    # The height of your painting, in number of blocks it takes up
    random_place: true # Will place at random from the vanilla painting items
  nexo:animated_painting:
    author: boy0000
    title: <red>Animated Custom Painting
    asset_id: nexo:animated_painting
    width: 1
    height: 1
```

Then you simply put the Texture of your painting inside Nexo's ResourcePack where your asset\_id points to. The format is as with everything else `namespace:path` which here points to the path `assets/namespace/textures/painting/path` .

For our above example it means we must put the texture inside `assets/nexo/textures/painting/custom_painting.png`&#x20;

### Animated Paintings

You can also make animated paintings using an MCMETA-file.\
The width & height properties are the pixel-size of each frame in your PNG.\
Below is a basic example, [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Resource_pack#Texture_animation) has a more in-depth explanation.\


{% code title="animated_painting.png.mcmeta" %}
```json
{
  "animation": {
    "width": 256,
    "height": 256,
    "frametime": 1
    
  }
}
```
{% endcode %}

This file needs to be named the same as your texture + .mcmeta\
For our above example it means we must put the texture inside `assets/nexo/textures/painting/animated_painting.png.mcmeta`&#x20;

### NexoItem

When your Custom Painting has been registered, you can make a custom NexoItem which will place the given painting. Below is a basic example

```yaml
custom_painting:
  itemname: Custom Painting
  material: PAINTING
  Components:
    painting_variant: nexo:custom_painting
animated_painting:
  itemname: Animated Painting
  material: PAINTING
  Components:
    painting_variant: nexo:animated_painting
```
